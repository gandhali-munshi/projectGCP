# Project GCP
This is an academic Project 
Where we imported data into Google cloud platform , created notebooks using pandas extracted and processed data and loaded into Bigquery , Visualized data using Google studio to get insights,
Modeled data using bigquery ML using vertex AI and GCS buckets deployed model to endpoint.
GCS has some example code for using the endpoint API that we used. Pandas can natively read and write to GCS buckets, so we used that to read source data and store predictions. We did this in a notebook within Vertex AI
